                <h3>Trip to kanyakumari</h3>
                <p>
                  Kanyakumari is a coastal town in the state of Tamil Nadu on India's southern tip. Jutting into the Laccadive Sea, the town was known as Cape Comorin during British rule and is popular for watching sunrise and sunset over the ocean.

                <p>
                  Madurai is an energetic, ancient city on the Vaigai River in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

                <h3>Trip to Kodaikanal </h3>
                <p>
                  I want to enjoy my summer vacation in a trip so I am selected kodaicanal as best place to enjoy nature. We booked travel package. They picked up in a vehicle in the morning. On the way we saw dolphins nose and taliyar falls once we reached kodai we checked in to a hotel. After that we visited kodailake, clocker walk, bryanth park we are amused by watching the different kinds of flowers. The bestpoint through out my trip is  kodai climate and upper lake view of kodai Lake. The temperature is very low. Expenses in kodai is bit high. When compared to  normal  places. Kodaicanal is famous for spices and ayurvedic medicine.
